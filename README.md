# TaskTracker
(In progress)

A cool app to keep track of your tasks!

Built in Android Studio with MVVM Architecure, using Room SQLite database for local data storage.

So far, the basic task creation function is implemented, with the storage in the database, as well as displaying and updating all the tasks realtime in a recyclerview. 

### TODO:
- Implement the agenda, calendar, and customizable settings fragments
- Add alarms and push notifications for reminders for tasks
- Implement a webscraper to find and create tasks from an input website (e.g. assignment due dates from a university/school website, library account books due dates, etc.)
